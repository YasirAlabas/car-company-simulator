# car-company-simulator
This was a project created for the Introduction to Software Engineering course that I took in KFUPM. The project aims to simulate a car company system with an administration dashboard and a customer dashboard where he can search for the specified car using a ceratin search engine embedded within the system. The project was conducted using Java and incorporated the use of the NetBeans windows builder.
