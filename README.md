# car-company-simulator
This was a project created for the Introduction to Software Engineering course that I took in KFUPM.
The project aims to simulate a car company system with an adminstration dashboard and a costumer dashboard where he can search for the specified car using a ceratin search engine embided within the the system.
The project was conducted using Java and incorporated the use of the NetBeans windows builder.
